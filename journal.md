Claim: The new regulation requiring cell phones to be put away during the school day is crucial for restoring focus to the learning environment.

Evidence: We've seen a noticeable decrease in classroom disruptions; before, notifications and social media use constantly fractured attention. Now, students are more engaged in discussions and activities, and teachers spend less time dealing with distraction issues.

Reasoning: These outcomes prove that, by removing the primary digital distraction, the law allows the teaching and learning environment to become more productive and cohesive. The benefit outweighs the initial challenge of adaptation, as the mental presence of students and teachers is now the priority.

Claim: Computer Science (CS) is an essential foundational skill that fundamentally reshapes every major industry and is critical for future career success, regardless of the specific field.

Evidence: The video features prominent figures, including Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook/Meta), Chris Bosh (NBA All-Star), and leaders from various tech and non-tech sectors (Dropbox, Pixar, UCSF, OPower), all emphasizing that CS is integral to their respective industries, from social media and professional sports to medicine and renewable energy.

Reasoning: The consensus among leaders from diverse professional backgrounds indicates that coding and computational thinking are no longer niche skills but rather universal tools that enable innovation and problem-solving in all fields. This proves that CS is a transformative element, empowering individuals to solve complex, real-world problems and highlighting why organizations like Code.org advocate for its widespread adoption in education. Furthermore, the video's message encourages learning CS because it is the driver of future innovation across the globe.

Claim: We will develop an adaptive AI tutor, MentorIA, to provide personalized, real-time curriculum and feedback for middle and high school students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects.

Evidence: The project meets the requirements by focusing on education and the responsible use of AI to diagnose learning gaps ethically. The solution is realistic because it uses advanced language models to generate tailored educational content and is creative by offering a learning experience that dynamically evolves with the student's needs.

Reasoning: MentorIA would level the playing field by providing high-quality, equitable, and low-cost educational support directly at home or in school. By adapting individually, it will help people overcome the frustration of one-size-fits-all instruction and significantly improve academic outcomes, promoting long-term success in vital careers.

Statement: It's an Excellent Idea
Working in a virtual store for real money is an excellent idea for the professional future. It represents one of the most promising career paths because it aligns perfectly with the growing digitalization of consumer behavior and offers high scalability and flexibility.

Evidence and Reasoning
Evidence (IKEA and Technology):

Major brands like IKEA are heavily investing in their online shopping experience, recognizing that the future of commerce is digital.

The video game industry proves that people are willing to spend real money on products that only exist in a virtual environment (items, skins), validating the entire economic model of digital commerce.

Reasoning:

This evidence demonstrates that the e-commerce market is robust and unstoppable.

Gaining experience in managing a virtual store (digital marketing, data analysis, e-commerce logistics) means mastering the skills that will be essential for almost any business in the next decade. It's a key investment in your professional future.

**Diary Entry: Technology and Disaster Resilience**

Technology plays an essential role in every phase of a natural disaster, from preparation to recovery. Before an event, **early warning systems** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, like that used in platforms such as Google Earth or advanced weather models, are crucial; these analyze satellite and sensor data to predict a hurricane's path or the risk of a wildfire with greater lead time and accuracy. During the disaster, **satellite communications** and **mobile phone networks** (cellular), though often stressed, allow emergency services to coordinate rescue efforts and enable people to send simple "safe" text messages, while **emergency apps** provide real-time evacuation maps and shelter locations. Afterward, the use of **drones** and **satellite image analysis** helps quickly assess damage in remote or dangerous areas to direct humanitarian aid and reconstruction. These tools make a monumental difference: an extra hours' notice for a hurricane can mean the safe evacuation of thousands of people, and constant communication during a flood can save lives by informing those who are trapped about escape routes or the location of rescuers.

If I could invent a new piece of technology, I would create a **"Post-Disaster Autonomous Mesh Network System" (PD-AMNS)**, specifically designed for environments where communication and power infrastructure have collapsed, such as after an earthquake or a major hurricane. This system would consist of small, modular communication devices that run on solar and kinetic (movement) energy and are deployed automatically (perhaps by drones or airdropped) over the affected area. Each module would create a connection point and, by linking with its neighbors, establish a decentralized **mesh network**, allowing any mobile phone or radio device in the area to send basic text messages and location data to rescue teams without relying on traditional cell towers or the internet. This would be fundamental because infrastructure failure is a recurring problem that delays assistance; the PD-AMNS would guarantee a basic communication channel for survivors to report their status and location, and could even transmit health signals from **wearable devices** to medical teams, accelerating the location of the injured and saving countless lives during the critical first few hours.N

 Technology and Food Access: Journal Reflection

The critical problem is the **interruption of SNAP program funding**, a vital safety net that allows millions of low-income families to purchase essential food each month. If the funds run out, this would become a huge problem as many people, especially children, the elderly, and people with disabilities who rely on this aid, would face severe **food insecurity** and the inability to buy healthy food.

Technology could mitigate this crisis through the development of applications or websites that serve as instant **resource hubs**. These tools could use geolocation to connect people with the nearest and most available food bank, community kitchen, or food assistance program, and even show real.
-time inventories and operating hours.

However, significant challenges exist, such as the **digital divide**, where a lack of reliable internet access or smartphones prevents the neediest from using these tech-based solutions. Furthermore, concerns about the privacy of personal and location data might deter some users.

If I were the designer, my tool would be called **"FoodFinder"**. It would be a mobile app and a website with a simple interface that doesn't require much data, and its main function would be to map and provide directions to free or low-cost food resources, including the time of their next distribution and what documents are needed for access
