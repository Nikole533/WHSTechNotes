**Diary Entry: Technology and Disaster Resilience**

Technology plays an essential role in every phase of a natural disaster, from preparation to recovery. Before an event, **early warning systems** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, like that used in platforms such as Google Earth or advanced weather models, are crucial; these analyze satellite and sensor data to predict a hurricane's path or the risk of a wildfire with greater lead time and accuracy. During the disaster, **satellite communications** and **mobile phone networks** (cellular), though often stressed, allow emergency services to coordinate rescue efforts and enable people to send simple "safe" text messages, while **emergency apps** provide real-time evacuation maps and shelter locations. Afterward, the use of **drones** and **satellite image analysis** helps quickly assess damage in remote or dangerous areas to direct humanitarian aid and reconstruction. These tools make a monumental difference: an extra hours' notice for a hurricane can mean the safe evacuation of thousands of people, and constant communication during a flood can save lives by informing those who are trapped about escape routes or the location of rescuers.

If I could invent a new piece of technology, I would create a **"Post-Disaster Autonomous Mesh Network System" (PD-AMNS)**, specifically designed for environments where communication and power infrastructure have collapsed, such as after an earthquake or a major hurricane. This system would consist of small, modular communication devices that run on solar and kinetic (movement) energy and are deployed automatically (perhaps by drones or airdropped) over the affected area. Each module would create a connection point and, by linking with its neighbors, establish a decentralized **mesh network**, allowing any mobile phone or radio device in the area to send basic text messages and location data to rescue teams without relying on traditional cell towers or the internet. This would be fundamental because infrastructure failure is a recurring problem that delays assistance; the PD-AMNS would guarantee a basic communication channel for survivors to report their status and location, and could even transmit health signals from **wearable devices** to medical teams, accelerating the location of the injured and saving countless lives during the critical first few hours.N

 Technology and Food Access: Journal Reflection

The critical problem is the **interruption of SNAP program funding**, a vital safety net that allows millions of low-income families to purchase essential food each month. If the funds run out, this would become a huge problem as many people, especially children, the elderly, and people with disabilities who rely on this aid, would face severe **food insecurity** and the inability to buy healthy food.

Technology could mitigate this crisis through the development of applications or websites that serve as instant **resource hubs**. These tools could use geolocation to connect people with the nearest and most available food bank, community kitchen, or food assistance program, and even show real.
-time inventories and operating hours.

However, significant challenges exist, such as the **digital divide**, where a lack of reliable internet access or smartphones prevents the neediest from using these tech-based solutions. Furthermore, concerns about the privacy of personal and location data might deter some users.

If I were the designer, my tool would be called **"FoodFinder"**. It would be a mobile app and a website with a simple interface that doesn't require much data, and its main function would be to map and provide directions to free or low-cost food resources, including the time of their next distribution and what documents are needed for access

technology has fundamentally changed the way we connect during the holidays, but I believe this change ultimately makes the experience worse. Claim: Although tools like video calls facilitate connection with distant family, their overall impact is negative because of how they erode the quality of presence in physical gatherings. Evidence: While services allow a virtual view of gift openings or dinners, the new devices themselves—and the associated push notifications—frequently pull attention away from those physically present at the table. This distraction replaces the depth of actual conversation with the shallow performance of sharing a moment online. Reasoning: I believe developers hold a strong responsibility to ensure holiday tech respects both privacy and family time. This responsibility exists because the design goal of many apps is maximum engagement, which fundamentally conflicts with the human need for focused, undistracted intimacy that the holidays demand. Therefore, features that default to low-distraction and minimize data harvesting during holiday periods should be standard.

Are you looking forward to Thanksgiving break?

Yes, that way I spend more time with my family

A real job that uses drones is a drone delivery operator, who controls drones to deliver packages. They use basic programming because the software helps plan routes and fly safely. In Texas, the salary for this job is around $20–$25 per hour based on common online searches. Usually, they need the FAA Part 107 license and some tech experience. I would like this job because it’s modern and drones are cool to use.

A self-driving car might fail to recognize a stopped school bus with its stop arm out because its cameras or sensors can struggle with lighting, reflections, or obstructed views that make the stop sign or flashing red lights hard to interpret. The AI might also not have enough training examples of school-bus scenarios in different conditions, causing it to misclassify what it’s seeing. Sometimes the system focuses on common traffic patterns and doesn’t treat a school bus as a special high-priority hazard.
If I were a programmer on the Waymo team, I would add a priority override rule: any possible detection of a school bus with flashing red lights should force an immediate stop, even if the system is uncertain. I’d also include a specialized detection model or redundant sensor logic dedicated to identifying school buses and their stop arms. Another improvement would be an emergency-stop fallback, where the car stops automatically whenever sensor data is unclear but suggests even a small chance of a school-bus stop event. Finally, I’d expand simulation and real-world testing to make sure the AI handles rare but critical scenarios consistently and safely.

Autcraft was created to solve the problem of bullying, harassment, and exclusion that many players, especially neurodivergent players, experienced in online games. It provides a safe and welcoming Minecraft server where autistic children and their families can feel comfortable being themselves. Unmoderated online spaces can lead to harm such as cyberbullying, hate speech, and emotional distress. Autcraft’s clear rules, active moderation, and strong community guidelines help protect users and create a positive experience. Developers have a responsibility to design safe spaces because users should not have to protect themselves from harm on their own. If developers ignore safety and inclusion, online spaces can become toxic and drive people away instead of bringing them together.

One way technology can help create fairness is by giving people a platform to share their voices and experiences. This matters because many people who are treated unfairly might not be heard without technology. An example of this could be students using social media or online petitions to speak out about bullying or unfair school rules. Technology also allows people to learn about injustice through videos, news, and educational websites. This helps because when more people are informed, they are more likely to take action and support change. Overall, technology helps create a more fair and just society by spreading awareness and encouraging people to stand up for themselves and others.

The test I took this week was the MAP test, and I feel pretty good about my performance because I stayed focused and tried my best on every question. One thing that went well was the reading section because I understood most of the passages. However, I found some of the math questions challenging, especially the ones that required multiple steps. I think test prep would help me do better next time because practicing more and reviewing strategies would help me feel more confident and improve my score.

Personal hygiene and self-care are important in shared environments because they help keep everyone healthy and comfortable. When people take care of themselves, it reduces the spread of germs and shows respect for others around them. It also helps create a more professional and positive environment where people feel comfortable being present.

Things like loud conversations, strong smells, or distracting behavior can make it hard for others to focus or feel comfortable. These distractions can interrupt learning or work and may cause stress or frustration for people who are trying to concentrate. Being aware of how our actions affect others helps create a better shared space.

Some reasonable expectations for professional behavior in shared spaces include practicing good hygiene, using respectful language, and keeping an appropriate volume when speaking. It is also important to respect personal space, control emotions, and be aware of your surroundings. These behaviors help maintain a respectful, focused, and welcoming environment for everyone.

The 2026 Winter Olympics, held in Italy from February 6–22, 2026, used advanced technology to improve fairness, safety, and athletic performance.

Claim

I believe the most important technology used in the 2026 Winter Olympics was motion tracking systems because they had the biggest impact on fairness in judged sports.

Evidence

This technology was used when athletes competed in figure skating and snowboarding events. Motion tracking cameras followed the athletes’ body movements during jumps and spins to measure things like rotation speed, height, landing angle, and balance. Judges could use this data along with instant replay to see whether a jump was fully completed or if a landing was unstable.

Reasoning

This affected the competition because it made scoring more accurate and less based on opinion. In the past, judges sometimes had to rely only on what they saw in real time, which could lead to mistakes or disagreements. With motion tracking, the data helped judges make fair decisions based on actual performance. However, one concern is that too much technology might take away from the human judgment aspect of sports like figure skating, where artistic performance also matters.

Extension 

There should be some limits on how much technology athletes are allowed to use in Olympic competition. While technology can improve fairness and safety, too much of it—like advanced performance-enhancing equipment—could give some athletes an unfair advantage if they have better access to expensive tools.
